abstract = "In 2013, OPTN/UNOS mandated that transplant centers collect data on living kidney donors (LKDs) at 6-months, 1-year, and 2-years post-donation, with policy-defined thresholds for the proportion of complete living donor follow-up (LDF) data submitted in a timely manner (60 days before or after the expected visit date). While mandated, it was unclear how centers across the country would perform in meeting thresholds, given potential donor and center-level challenges of LDF. To better understand the impact of this policy, we studied SRTR data for 31,615 LKDs between 1/2010-6/2015, comparing proportions of complete and timely LDF form submissions pre- and post-policy implementation. We also used multilevel logistic regression to assess donor- and center-level characteristics associated with complete and timely LDF submissions. Complete and timely 2-year LDF increased from 33% pre-policy (1/2010-1/2013) to 54% post-policy (2/2013-6/2015) (p<0.001). In an adjusted model, the odds of 2-year LDF increased by 22% per year pre-policy (p<0.001) and 23% per year post-policy (p<0.001). Despite these annual increases in LDF, only 43% (87/202) of centers met the OPTN/UNOS-required 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year LDF thresholds for LKDs who donated in 2013. These findings motivate further evaluation of LDF barriers and the optimal approaches to capturing outcomes after living donation."
